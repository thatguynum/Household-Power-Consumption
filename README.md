# Household-Power-Consumption
This project predicts energy consumption in a household with time-series meter readings over each minute.
The notebook contains descriptive analytics, univarate and multivariate time series forecasting 

## Goals
The focus of this analysis will be to predict global_active_power.

## Visualization
* Perform descriptive analytics on the global_active_power and global_reactive_power variable
* Plot time series of all the variables over the entire four year timeframe


## Forecasting
Apply and evaluate the following forecasting methods to the global_active_power time series:
* AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
* Rolling Forecast Origin on ARIMA
* Long Short Term Memory Neural Network -(LSTM)

Apply and evaluate the following forecasting methods to the global_reactive_power time series:
* Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)
